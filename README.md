# A Place to Play with Tensorflow and Keras

If I keep myself organized, everything in src will have a jupyter notebook
demonstrating the architecture used/described therein.


### Things to try at some point

Text Detection CTPN

## TODO:
- [ ] YOLO: get pretrained weights incorporate into network
- [ ] YOLO: run (on small image set) to ensure operation
