# A Place to Play with Tensorflow and Keras

If I keep myself organized, everything in src will have a jupyter notebook
demonstrating the architecture used/described therein.


### Things to try at some point

Text Detection CTPN
https://github.com/eragonruan/text-detection-ctpn
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03605

YOLO - you only look once
object identification and location
http://machinethink.net/blog/object-detection-with-yolo/
https://github.com/experiencor/basic-yolo-keras
https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242

## TODO:
- [ ] YOLO: get pretrained weights incorporate into network
- [ ] YOLO: run (on small image set) to ensure operation
